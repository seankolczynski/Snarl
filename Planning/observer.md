For this class we are imagining that it will be the “God-view” of our game for use in the local client that will connect to our gameserver that will hold the model. The client will initialize this with the initial level generated by the server and continuously update it with the updated boards after player/adversary moves sent by  the server. It will be able to render to the terminal what the adversaries would look like with colours differentiating and enhancing the view for the stakeholders.
